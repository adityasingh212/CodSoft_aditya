Task 1 :- Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.
 
Code Implementation :-
def chatbot():
   print("Chatbot: Hi! I'm here to help. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.")
   
   while True:
       # Get user input
       user_input = input("You: ").strip().lower()
       
       # Exit condition
       if user_input == "exit":
           print("Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!")
           break
       
       # Responses based on user input
       if "hello" in user_input or "hi" in user_input:
           print("Chatbot: Hello! How can I assist you today?")
       elif "how are you" in user_input:
           print("Chatbot: I'm just a program, but I'm functioning as expected! How about you?")
       elif "your name" in user_input:
           print("Chatbot: I'm a simple chatbot. You can call me Bot!")
       elif "help" in user_input:
           print("Chatbot: Sure! Let me know what you need help with.")
       elif "time" in user_input:
           from datetime import datetime
           print(f"Chatbot: The current time is {datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S')}.")
       else:
           print("Chatbot: I'm sorry, I don't understand that. Could you rephrase?")
